**Hellow EVERYONE**

**This is Engr.Mahwish Memon** 

In this repository i am going to share my knowledge about openCV (Computer Vision) with you.

OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. 
The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source Apache 2 License. 

I am working on Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) for this course.
